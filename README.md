A spooky animated eye for your Jack-o'-lantern, using a 240x240 TFT display (GC9A01) and a microcontroller like the Pico. Watch as the eye gazes around and changes colors, adding a high-tech touch to your Halloween decorations.

## Features
- Uses a 240x240 TFT display (GC9A01)
- Smooth eye animations with various color palettes
- Supports blinking and directional gazing
- High resolution for more expressive movements

## Inspiration
